separate things:
    ability to draw a start point, end point, wall and remove blocks
    select different algorithms to solve the maze
    set the MazeSolver object's solving strategy to the requested algorithm
    get the MazeSolution object from the MazeSolver.solve()

    the window should be able to display JUST the solution,
    and it should be able to draw each decision by a specified interval



MazeSolution:
    should be a data structure, no methods

    coordinate[] plain solution
    amount of steps to solve
    length of solution


Board:
    +clearBoard()
    +getPieceAt()
    +setPieceAt()
    +changeBoardSize()


mainScreen is a jpanel:
    -boardPanel:jpanel
    -algorithmSelectComboBox



specific state behaviour is:
draw blocks (on showing solution state this does nothing)
remove nodes (on showing solution state this only removes solution blocks)
clear (on insert state this clears entire board, on showing solution state this removes only the solution)

need to separate the onEvent methods from the state specific behaviour
onEvent methods decides which methods to call and those methods delegate those methods to it's current state



node selector needs:
